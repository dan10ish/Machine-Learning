#Fashion MNIST Project

**Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)** is a foundational dataset for learning and benchmarking algorithms. It is compromised of `70,000` handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are `28 x 28` grayscale. Fashion MNIST contains pictures of 10 different types of clothing.

In this Machine Learning model we will try to recognize what type of clothing is the given picture from the **MNIST TensorFlow dataset**.
